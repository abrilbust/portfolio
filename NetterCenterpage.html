      My Work as a Mentor at the Netter Center
    </h5>

    <div class="full-width-text">
At the Netter Center for Community Partnerships, I served as a mentor for a Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) project focused on mental health advocacy among high school students in West Philadelphia. 
	My role involved guiding 15 students through the full research processâ€”from designing their project and collecting qualitative and quantitative data to analyzing findings and facilitating focus groups. Weekly sessions built their research and communication skills, while also fostering leadership and community engagement. Through our conversations, students candidly shared the pressures they face, including academic stress, family dynamics, and limited access to mental health resources. These insights revealed the urgent need to destigmatize mental health and improve school-based support systems. I helped the students translate their lived experiences into actionable recommendations, such as expanding peer support programs and on-site counseling, that we shared with school administrators. This experience not only allowed me to support youth-driven advocacy, but also deepened my understanding of how systemic barriers impact mental health outcomes and access to care in underserved communities.
