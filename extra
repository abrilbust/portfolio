	BUILD Nigeria is a non-profit and NGO dedicated to preparing Nigerian pre-college students for world-class colleges and universities. As an internal curriculum intern, my work involved engaging with different stakeholders of the cohort program to understand how best to make improvements, and refine internal documents to make the curriculum scalable and replicable. I interviewed alumni students to gather feedback on their goals, experiences, and suggestions for program improvements. Using this data, I collaborated with the team to determine realistic and actionable enhancements based on our needs and resources. To aid in replication and scalability, I created a master program document that details all aspects of the program, making it easier for others to run. Additionally, I compiled actionable recommendations for curriculum inclusions, highlighting areas such as integration of cohort student feedback, increased test prep center funding, and alumni involvement in curriculum development. Although these internal documents are confidential, I also developed a flyer for client engagement with students and their parents which is attached to the right. Furthermore, my final deliverables included designing a slidedeck the team can used when pitching to investors as well as two presentations to the team to update them on my work.
