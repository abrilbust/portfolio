As a research intern at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in Ann Arbor, MI, I was given the opportuniy to contribute to groundbreaking research on regulatory T cell (Treg) subsets, a subpopulation of CD4+ T cells. Exploring their therapeutic benefit, we explored their role as a potential therapy for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). My work included measuring RNA expression, protein expression, and conducting chemotaxis experiments to evaluate treg subset functionality. I became more experienced in experimental design, data analysis, and research techniques including tissue to single cell suspension, cell isolation, gradient centrifugation, and flow cytometry. The adjacent research poster provides an overview of my study, showcasing the results and implications of my findings.
