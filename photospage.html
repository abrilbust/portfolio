     VAW: Global Health Alliances
    </h5>

    As the Co-VP of Education and Training for Penn's Chapter of VAW: Global Health Alliances, 
    I was involved in establishing the program on campus. Our team was the first to recruit students 
    for a medical internship aborad in Guatemala during the summer. In my role, I was tasked with 
    teaching clinical skills and Spanish to students, as well as assisting with the logistics and
fundraising efforts necessary for the program's success. I was also dedicated to fostering team cohesion 
through regular meetinfs, where I conducted demonstrations and presentations on clinical skills and 
cultural sensitivity to prepare students for the internship. While abroad, I served as one of the
leaders, staying with host families and collaborating with local healthcare professionals to conducts 
primary mobile clinics in rural areas with limited healthcare access. I worked in various stations spanning 
from intake to vitals to diagnosis and pharmacy. In addition to medical knowledge, I gained a new sense of gratitude for my health, 
resources, and overall lifestyle in the U.S. after working with these patients. Finding a 
free clinic with in-house medical doctors and pharmacy that is also open to the general public is rare there. This experience put into perspective the relative ease with which I can access medical care at home. One eye-opening conversation with an in-clinic nurse in Spanish left a lasting impact on me. She informed me that many people, especially children, contract parasites from the unfiltered water or suffer from illnesses that may be fatal without proper treatment every day. Their barriers to healthcare include the lack of education in understanding general hygiene, unaffordable precautionary measures (i.e. a water filter), and prohibitive medical fees. So, I asked, “What happens then?” her response was stark and heartbreaking: “They die.” 
Despite mildly understanding the conditions surrounding health prior to this trip, this answer stripped me of words. The nature of Guatemala’s healthcare crisis, exacerbated by issues like corruption, needs financially viable and innovative solutions. Bridging the gaps in healthcare accessibility, I helped restart the Guatemala Health Initiative to educate the Penn community about health policies in Guatemala and raise funds for Hospitalito Atitlán.  The experience was incredibly rewarding; I cherished meeting 
new people, holding babies while their mothers were tested, and receiving heartfelt "thank you" messages from the community. For more information about VAW: Global Health Alliances, please visit their
