	BUILD Nigeria is a non-profit and NGO dedicated to preparing Nigerian pre-college students for world-class colleges and universities. As an Internal Curriculum Intern at BUILD Nigeria, I worked on expanding access to higher education for underrepresented Nigerian youth by redesigning and scaling the organization’s academic curriculum. I collaborated with four internal departments and engaged with over a dozen stakeholders—including alumni, program leads, and student participants—to gather qualitative data and translate insights into actionable program enhancements. My work culminated in a replicable curriculum model and a comprehensive master document to support scalability across future cohorts. To support client and investor engagement, I developed promotional materials such as flyers and investor-facing slide decks. I also led two presentations to the team summarizing my research, strategy, and proposed improvements. This experience not only deepened my skills in curriculum design and stakeholder analysis but also allowed me to apply data-driven decision-making in a globally impactful education initiative.
